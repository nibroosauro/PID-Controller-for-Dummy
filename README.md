# PID-Controller-for-Omniwheel-Base-Four
This repository implements a PID controller for a four-wheeled omniwheel base, designed to ensure smooth, precise multi-directional movement. The controller dynamically adjusts wheel speeds, correcting errors in real time to optimize stability and responsiveness for robotic applications requiring advanced mobility.
